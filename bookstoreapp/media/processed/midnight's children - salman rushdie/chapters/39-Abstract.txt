Winner of the “Booker of Bookers,” Midnight's Children is the novel that can be said to have done for Indian literature what One Hundred Years of Solitude did for the literature of the Americas, exciting a boom whose echoes have yet to fade.
At the same instant that India achieves independence from Great Britain – the stroke of midnight on August 15th, 1947 – Saleem Sinai tumbles into existence in a room in Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home in Bombay. He is singularly unprepared for the powers he soon develops: telepathy, an intense sense of smell, and above all, a peculiar sympathy with the growing pains of the troubled and newly independent India…
Published to enormous acclaim in 1981, Midnight's Children is the story of Saleem's fate, linked inextricably to that of his country by the accidental timing of his birth. Narrated with sheer stylistic brilliance, it unfurls the myriad joys, dramas, and catastrophes both major and minor of the people of India, both real and imagined. Saleem communicates with 1,000 other “midnight's children” – born auspiciously between twelve and one a.m. on that same night – as the nation descends into Indira Gandhi's State of Emergency. War, colonialism, several family sagas, and religion all intertwine in this shining epic of a novel, while time ticks by and the children approach their futures. Comic, ebullient, and fantastic, this is a book of wild inventiveness and imagination – a landmark work from one of the great writers of our time.
